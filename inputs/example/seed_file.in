PUFFIN SEED FILE

Describes seed fields for input into puffin. Multiple seeds with
different frequencies, profiles and positions can be used. Please 
refer to POP-REF for an explanation of the scaled variables used, 
such as z2.

SEED 1:-

1.0                    FreqFrac            Ratio of seed to resonant frequency i.e. omega_s / omega_r
0.0                    A0_X                Initial peak field value (real, also the x-polarized field)
0.0                    A0_Y                Initial peak field value (imaginary, also the y-polarized field)
0.7             SigmaX              Seed field sigma in x direction (Calculated in code for matched beam) =1E8 for flat top
0.7             SigmaY              Seed field sigma in y direction (Calculated in code for matched beam) =1E8 for flat top
0.7           SigmaZ2             Seed field sigma in z2 direction =1E8 for flat top
.FALSE.                 qFlatTop            =.TRUE. if flat top seed, else gaussian is assumed
1.0                    MeanZ2              Mean or center position of seed in Z2
