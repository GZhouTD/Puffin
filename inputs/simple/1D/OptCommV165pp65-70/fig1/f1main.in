! The main input parameters are described below - Puffin takes the namelist blocks at the
! bottom of this file as input. This is the 'main' input file, containing info about the 
! wiggler, field sampling, and general flags and other numerical instructions for the
! simulation. This file also points to a beam file, seed file, and optionally a lattice 
! file.

!
!
! qOneD                      If TRUE, model 1D FEL, with only 1 field node and 1 macroparticle in transverse dimensions
! qFieldEvolve               if letting the radiation field evolve
! qElectronsEvolve           if integrating electron equations
! qElectronFieldCoupling     if allowing field to feedback onto the electron equations
